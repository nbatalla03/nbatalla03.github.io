  <h2>Side Projects</h2>
  <p>For as long as I can remember, I have always tinkered. Whether its opening up my remote control car or looking at source code. I have always enjoyed looking under the hood to get a better idea of how things worked. It's this propensity to break things apart that has lead me to web development, and I believe is a characteristic that will lead to a successful web development career.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it isn't a good idea to break things in production. This is where side projects come in. I want to point out that a side project doesn't have to be anything big, it can be small, it also doesn't have to be something you make, it can simply be something you want to learn.</p>

<p>There are various benefits to starting a side project. The following list is far from exhaustive, but these are benefits I've personally observed from my side project exploits.</p>

<h4>Expand Skills</h4>

<p>I want to make clear that I believe your skills will expand regardless of the complexity of your side project. On that note, I challenge you to implement something that will cause you frustration. I truly believe the fastest way to expand your skills is to tackle something slightly above your current level.</p>

<p>I relate this process to building muscle. In order to build muscle you have to put enough stress on your muscles to cause fatigue. Repeat this process enough and you will build muscle. Admittedly, this is simplified, but it gets the point I across, I hope :).</p>

<h4>Broaden Perspective</h4>

<p>Part of being a good consultant is having perspective. Clients come to us and pay us good money to bring their ideas to life. We act as navigators adeptly guiding them to their goal. It's having perspective that we can avoid the pitfalls which will undoubtedly exist in our path.</p>

<p>So where does side projects fit into all of this? If you've taken my advice and challenged yourself by implementing technologies and methods slightly above your level, you gain perspective on their benefits and pitfalls. You learn what parts of the new technology/method can bring improvement to your current process, as well as the potential pitfalls it will have on a client project.</p>

<p>The more you expose yourself to new things, the better your perspective becomes. Your ability to consult increases due to your new and broadening perspective.</p>

<h4>Refresh</h4>

<p>If you're like me, working on the same thing can get boring, and boredom can suck the life out of a client project, worse yet, adversely impact the project. As you probably already guessed, having a side project can alleviate this.</p>

<p>Think of it as taking a brief jaunt around the park. The idea here is to step away for a moment and look at something new. I buy into the idea that as humans, we get excited about new things, use this to your advantage. I promise you that when you come back, you'll feel refreshed and ready to tackle that once boring project.</p>

<h4>Set a Goal</h4>

<p>This section isn't so much a benefit, but rather something to keep in mind to maximize the benefits of having a side project.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of side projects, they are often times not taken seriously. This can limit the benefits of having a side project or worse defeat it's purpose. By setting goals, you hold yourself accountable. Keep in mind that you should break down your side project into manageable goals and not one large goal of "complete side project".</p>

<p>Setting a goal is so painfully obvious, which is why it's also so easily discarded as something you should take into consideration. I would dare to say that the success of your side project can be made or broken at this stage.</p>

<p>So, what are you going to build?</p>
