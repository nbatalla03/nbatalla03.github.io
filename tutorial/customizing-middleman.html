  <h2>Customizing Middleman</h2>
  <p>The intention of this blog post is not to be an exhaustive tutorial on customizing 
Middleman, instead I'll cover a few things I customized to fit my needs.</p>



<h4>Organizing Blog Articles</h4>
<p>By default, Middleman puts all your articles in the source directory, which contain 
files such as your index, layout, feed, calendar, etc... You can imagine as your blog 
post count grows, it will become increasingly cumbersome to sort through your source folder.</p>

<p>Luckily there is a simple solution. By opening your <strong>config.rb</strong> 
(located in the source folder) and adding the following line of code between the active 
<strong>:blog do |blog|</strong> block:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/nbatalla03/9318774.js"></script>

<p>In plain english the above code tells Middleman to look in the <strong>articles</strong> 
directory with the filename format of <strong>{year}-{month}-{day}-{title}.html</strong>.</p>

<p>The next step is to create a directory named articles inside your source folder and add 
all your blog articles in this folder with the above file naming format. It is very important 
you follow the file naming format above, otherwise Middleman can't find your articles.</p>

<p>I would like to point out that you can name your directory and file name format differently. 
Just make sure that they match up to blog.sources portion in your config.rb file.</p>

<h4>Project Structure</h4>
<p>Since we are on the topic of organization, having projects in its own directory helps 
keeps things seperated and in the long run easier to maintain.</p>

<p>For example, I had to make a typography project for my apprenticeship. This project 
was going to have it's own unique layout, look, feel, and style. Originally I was going 
to put everything into my main CSS file which contained the styling for the site you are
looking at now. I immediately shot down that idea, as it would be a management nightmare 
making sure I didn't duplicate class names.</p>

<p>By having a seperate folder for each project I am able to make as many projects as I want
without worry of overlap. To implement this you'll have to create a layout file and place
it inside the layouts directory. The name of the file is up to you, I named my
<strong>projects-layout.erb</strong>. The only piece of code you'll have to put inside the
projects-layout file is:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/nbatalla03/9319234.js"></script>

<p>The reason for having a layout for projects, is to bypass Middleman's default layout, we don't want this because we need a blank slate
so we can style our project however we want without pulling from the blog styles.</p>

<p>Ok, we are at the home stretch. If this is a little confusing, I want you think about how
you would start a project. I imagine it would look something like create an index page, a CSS file,
and maybe even a Javascript file. If that is your typical setup, you'll find this process exactly the same, with
with one difference. That difference is adding this piece of code above each page of your project.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/nbatalla03/9319351.js"></script>

<p>Middleman calls this frontmatter, I won't go into detail regarding frontmatter, Middleman docs cover
this really well. Basically this piece of frontmatter code stops Middleman from using the default layout
and instead use the projects-layout instead.</p>

<h4>Project List</h4>
<p>Middleman has a blog gem that makes it easy to iterate over your blog articles and list them, you can 
see this in action by going to my homepage. I wanted a way to iterate over all my projects and list them,
instead of having to manually add each projects I made into the list.</p>

<p>Middleman makes this process relatively easy to do:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/nbatalla03/9319403.js"></script>

<p>The above code still iterates over all my articles, but checks to see if the category is filed under
<strong>projects</strong>. The code will run through all my articles and return all articles filed under
projects and will show the latest 10.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/nbatalla03/9319487.js"></script>

<p>You're probably wondering why I'm iterating over blog articles to find projects. Short answer, I haven't
found a better solution than this. So to link to a project you simply make a new article with the frontmatter
setup in the example code above. Just make sure that the name of the directory of your project matches the
permalink in the frontmatter.</p>

<h4>Resources</h4>
<p>Middleman has great documentation, I recommend taking a look at their documentation on <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/basics/frontmatter/">frontmatter</a>, <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/basics/helpers/">template helpers</a>, and <a href="http://middlemanapp.com/basics/templates/">templates</a> to get started.</p>
