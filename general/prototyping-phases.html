  <h2>Prototyping Phases</h2>
  <p>As a visual person, I want to dive head first into the best part of web design - the final working product. Those who have worked on a few projects know approaching it from this angle can be costly.</p>

<p>As I wind down on a project I'm working on, I want to reflect on the phases of prototyping I went through to get to the final working product.</p>

<h4>Low Fidelity</h4>

<p>Low fidelity prototyping to me is pen and paper. I have an art background and nothing quite replaces the tactile feedback of pen to paper. However, there is more to using pen and paper than great feedback.</p>

<p>The idea behind using something as simple as pen a paper in the initial stages of prototyping is to blot out the details. It's important to remove the distractions of details to help you focus on how the website will be used, rather than how it will look.</p>

<p>I remember reading a blog post on 37 Signals on how they preferred using thick markers in their initial prototyping phase because it wouldn't allow them to make intricate lines. This approach lends itself well to blotting out the details.</p>

<h4>Medium Fidelity</h4>

<p>Medium fidelity prototypes typically introduces the use of some type of prototyping software. My experiences with prototyping software is limited to Balsamiq. I have seen a few others out there and I'm sure they will do exactly what you need them to do. In short, use what you know.</p>

<p>The great thing about medium fidelity prototypes, it gives your clients something to touch. Which is why I love Balasamiq's feature of being able to link together prototype mockups where your client can get a feel for how the project will work in a tangible way.</p>

<p>The focus of the medium fidelity phase is to make sure the users needs are met, as well as optimizing user experience. Depending on your prototyping software, getting feedback on user experience by simply linking mockups together is invaluable at this stage of the project.</p>

<p>In this phase your primary concerns should center around gathering user data to help improve user experience. The nature of the mockups makes it easy to adapt necessary design changes from the data you gather.</p>

<h4>High Fidelity</h4>

<p>Personally this is the best phase in my eyes. It's where you get to explore the look and feel of the project. High fidelity mockups are often mistaken for the final product, in actuality it's one step before.</p>

<p>It's also during this phase that I'll break out Photoshop and start experimenting with colors, typography, logos etc... This is also the phase in which I code up the design and functionality and continue to move towards the final product.</p>

<p>It's important to note that these are merely guidelines and the requirements for your project may differ. I believe this is a good base to add to or subtract from and have personally found that it helped mitigate costly mistakes on time.</p>
