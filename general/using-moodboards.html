  <h2>Using Mood Boards</h2>
  <p>
  I have read about mood boards in the past, but have not personally tried it out myself 
  with a client, until recently.
</p>



<h4>What Is a Mood Board?</h4>
<p>
  So what is a mood board? In short, it’s a collection of assets that tries to capture 
  the feel and direction of a project. These assets can be both digital and tactile. 
  Keep in mind mood boards are like sketches, they aren’t intended to be polished versions of the project.
</p>

<h4>Why Use Them?</h4>
<p>
  So why should we use mood boards?
</p>

<p>
  It was due to the openness of this particular project that prompted me to explore mood boards. 
  I felt I had a good grasp of what the client wanted, however I wanted to confirm this without 
  spending too much time with the details, as we all know can be a resource drain. 
  Mood boards help mitigate spending a lot of time going in the wrong direction, as everything is in flux.
</p>

<p>
  While this is my first time using a mood board, I feel projects that are open or vague are 
  good reasons to use mood boards. They allow you to explore and experiment, also they are great 
  at furthering discussion at your next meeting since nothing is highly defined, everything is 
  open to change/refinement. 
</p>

<h4>How I Proceeded</h4>
<p>
  I typically have imagery start floating in my head during meetings as I process the 
  client’s requests. It’s this flow that I tried to emulate during the creation of my mood board. 
  I wanted uninhibited flow. How I achieved this is by collecting every asset I thought fit 
  the feel and direction of this project, without questioning or debating why. 
  My assets were all digital images for those wondering.
</p>

<p>
  As you can imagine, my assets grew pretty large, which is fine. The next thing I had to do was refine. 
  Admittedly this wasn’t as fun as the first part of this process. Again, I didn't scrutinize too much in the refinement process, I employed the help of my mentor as a second pair of eyes to have a more objective way of purning assets out.
</p>

<h4>How I Presented</h4>
<p>
  The great thing about presenting mood boards is the expectation of the client. They aren’t 
  looking for polish, they are looking for a direction. With this in mind, I approach meetings 
  that center around mood boards like an open forum. It’s through this open discussion that helps 
  you further narrow down the project.
</p>

<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
<p>
  I like mood boards. They are relatively easy to put together. It brings clients closer to 
  the process, it also keeps meetings light and conversational, which I can’t see anything 
  negative about. Best of all it mitigates the possibility of going down the wrong path without wasting company resources.
