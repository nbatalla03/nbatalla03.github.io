  <h2>Brick by Brick</h2>
  <p>My mentor Stephanie passed along a book for me to read titled Brick by Brick authored by Stephen McCraine. At first glance I wasn't sure what to make of it, you see, this book isn't actually a book, it's a comic.</p>



<p>The opening paragraphs of this book is thought provoking. The idea that people are born with talent vs people acquire talent has always been a fascinating topic for me. Personally my beliefs sit somewhere in the middle. The author sides with the idea that deliberate practice can achieve mastery, and I certainly can't argue with that.</p>

<h4>My Takeaway</h4>

<p>There is a section in the comic that talks about observing the artist and not the art. I believe there is a connection that can be made with web development, that by studying the principles of the creators we can further achieve mastery.</p>

<p>Brick by Brick is an outline of these principles. You may be wondering how this applies to web design. Personally, I see web design as art, and these principles can certainly apply, in fact these principles can be applied to any medium.</p>

<h4>Principles</h4>

<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>

<p>This is probably the most overused principle ever, but its worth repeating. By having a goal you have a direction to head towards, and by having a direction you can start planning.</p>

<p><strong>Make Plans</strong></p>

<p>Now that you have a direction, it's important to make plans to reach your goals. If you're like me, your goals are lofty. To avoid getting paralyzed by the enormity of your goal, you must break it down into bite size pieces. This is called planning. By planning you can take steps towards your goal instead of being weighed down by your goal.</p>

<p><strong>Be Proactive</strong></p>

<p>Being proactive mean you diligently execute your plans and you put yourself in a better position to react to the future instead of being pushed around by the future. You do not wait for what can be accomplished today for tomorrow.</p>

<h4>Closing</h4>

<p>Brick by Brick is filled with lots of commonsense. It's funny how commonsense is usually what leaves our body first. This is a nice little handbook to keep around to remind us and keep us on track towards artistic mastery.</p>

<p>You can learn more of the principles by grabbing a copy <a href="http://doodlealley.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Until next time!</p>
