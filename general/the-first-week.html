  <h2>The First Week</h2>
  <p>Part of being an apprentice at 8th Light is to document our apprenticeship via blogging. I want to start off my very first blog post by reflecting on my first week at 8th Light.</p>



<p>To say that my first week flew by would be an understatement. Time truly does fly when you're having fun, it's exciting to be in the mix again since graduating DBC.</p>

<h4>Clojure and Hiccup</h4>

<p>One of the earliest experiences that sticks out in my memory is a pairing session I had with my mentor Stephanie. She was working on a project written in Clojure using Hiccup. Hiccup is a library for representing HTML in Clojure. I haven't ever coded in Clojure before, I liken the experience to getting a new toy. Here's a code snippet to give you an idea of what Clojure/Hiccup looks like:</p>

<h4>Reading Materials</h4>

<p>The very first book that was assigned to me was <strong><em>Thinking With Type</em></strong>. I'll be honest, my typical process for selecting fonts has been selecting fonts that I thought look good visually. Ellen Lupton, the author of Thinking With Type has redefined my process and the way I think about fonts. It's simply not enough to pick a font that looks good, one must consider the audience, content, layout, and other factors before settling on a font. Part of the reading assigment required an accompanying typography site, showcasing what I learned, you can view that <a href="/typography-deux/">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Blogging Tool - Middleman</h4>
<p>I'm using Middleman as my blogging tool. Although it's probably more accurate to describe Middleman as a static site generator rather than a blogging tool such as Wordpress. I'll be going over how I customized Middleman to fit my needs in upcoming posts.</p>

<p>Until next time.</p>
