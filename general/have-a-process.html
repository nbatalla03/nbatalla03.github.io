  <h2>Have a Process</h2>
  <p>I can't stress enough that having a process can make or break project. As my apprenticeship here at 8th Light draws to a close, I have a heightened sense of responsibility for the projects I tackle. Clients look to us for our expertise, and it is our responsibility to exercise that expertise in a timely manner, a great way to do that is by having a process.</p>

<p>If you're anything like me, you like to jump into the bells and whistle of a project, the "looks", in simpler terms. The problem with this approach is you neglect the very important steps of defining a problem to tackle. By jumping head first into the looks you don't have a clear path, this causes a lot of backtracking as you try solve design problems on the "fly", which I assure you leads to frustration, and that frustration leads to wasted time. Not good.</p>

<h4>The How</h4>

<p>I want to make clear that the process I use is what fits me and my work style. The important take away here is to <strong>have</strong> a process. There are a ton of resources out there that cover processes in greater detail, I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Responsive-Design-Workflow-Stephen-Hay/dp/0321887867">Responsive Design Workflow</a> by Stephen Hay, keep in mind that you should never treat anyone's process as gospel, learn and apply what makes sense to you.</p>

<p>
  <strong>Pen and Paper</strong>
</p>

<p>Having an art background, nothing quite replaces the feel of pen to paper. I actually recommend using a marker, preferably one with a thick nib so you can't get too detailed with it. The reasoning behind this is that you focus on solving a design problem rather than fiddling around with the minute details, this also gives you the flexibility you need to quickly put down your ideas. If you're thinking couldn't we just do this in a wire framing tool like Balsamiq, the simple answer would be it gives us too much detail, the pen and paper phase is to get your ideas down unrestricted by the details that a wire framing tool provides.</p>

<p>
  <strong>Wireframing</strong>
</p>

<p>After I have a few good sketches of layouts I believe will work, I'll jump into a wire framing tool. Personally I use Balsamiq, it isn't important what software you use so as long as you're familiar with the tools that it won't slow you down. The purpose of using a wire framing tool is to be able to get a more "real" feel of how the elements of your design will work with one another. Wireframes are fluid, software like Balsamiq allows you to easily make changes before you apply the finer details.</p>

<p>
  <strong>Coding</strong>
</p>

<p>There has been a growing popularity with using code to wireframe, personally I'm not quite there yet. The idea is to quickly lay down code markup so you can experience your design solution in it's native environment. Keep in mind you are coding the structure of your design solution and keeping it simple, don't even think about adding drop shadows. You make adjustments along the way and work towards a more polished version with each iteration.</p>

<p>
  <strong>Closing</strong>
</p>

<p>The great thing about UX is it's constantly changing, what we deem good practice today may be considered obsolete tomorrow. Keeping a flexible and open mind to new processes while continuing to refine your current process will serve you well. While I will always recommend trying new things, take the things you learn with a grain of salt, be judicious in what you add into your current process, not everything you read will be a good fit.</p>
