  <h2>Inspiration</h2>
  <p>Wouldn't it be cool if inspiration was a switch you could just turn on whenever you needed it? That sounds like the opening pitch to an amazing product, unfortunately I don't think such a product exists, at least not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>I would venture to say that a web designer experiences some sort of inspiration paralysis regularly. I can certainly attest to being in the unfortunate position of being stuck in various stages of projects I have worked on, unsure of what direction to head towards. While I haven't created the "inspiration on" pill yet, I have a few tips that have served me well during my inspirational slumps.</p>

<h4>Read</h4>

<p>I can't comment on the effectiveness of reading fiction in drawing inspiration, so I'll recommended you stick to reading books within a similar vein as web design. You can be liberal with the similarities, in fact I encourage you to pick up a javascript book if you haven't already done so, they don't all have to be about web design.</p>

<p>Exposing yourself to different things broadens your perspective, it helps to connect the dots. It's through this process of learning something new, that a spark of inspiration pops into my periphery. While the things I learn isn't always applicable, it usually leads to something that is. Reading also better equips you for the future, you never know when you may run into a design problem that will be solved by something you've read.</p>

<h4>Look at Other Sites</h4>

<p>I'm a big fan of looking at gallery sites like bestwebgallery.com, webcreme.com, thebestdesign.com, and a handful of others. The thing to keep in mind while looking at other sites isn't to simply marvel at how good the site looks, but to take mental notes on elements that solves a design problem similar to one that you have to solve on your project.</p>

<p>Expand your source, don't draw all your inspiration from one site. By drawing inspiration from various sites, you avoid having a site that looks too similar, since you are integrating various design solutions. A quote from Picasso comes to mind, "Good artists copy, great artists steal."</p>

<h4>Look Outside</h4>

<p>While I personally believe that there isn't anything truly original anymore, that doesn't mean we can't innovate. I believe the best way to innovate is to look for inspiration outside the medium you work in.</p>

<p>While it makes sense to look at gallery sites to draw inspiration from, this can limit you. It's especially because we are web designers, that we should look outside the mediums which we are comfortable with. Mediums such as painting, print, photography, etc... are great places to look for inspiration that is outside of where we normally look.</p>

<h4>Stay Excited</h4>

<p>I still remember the first time I made a website during Geocities' prominence. The excitement I felt when I learned I could meld art and technology together is something that still exists today. I feel extremely lucky to be  in an industry that is constantly changing and renewing my excitement year after year. By staying excited you will read that new book on some new technology, and continue to look at other sites that continue to innovate, and be compelled to look outside to innovate yourself.</p>
