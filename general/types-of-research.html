  <h2>Types of Research</h2>
  <p>I recently closed the books on a project I have been working on for the better part of my apprenticeship. Looking back, I'm content with how the project played out, but there have been areas which I feel could have gone more smoothly, particularly the research process.</p>

<p>I brought this up with my mentor who recommended a book titled <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/just-enough-research">Just Enough Research</a>. As you may have guessed it's a book covering research.</p>

<p>Before I get to the types of research, I want to point out that you don't necessarily employ all the research types in one project. You should only employ the research types that the project calls for.</p>

<h4>Generative Research</h4>

<p>Generative research is the type of research you conduct if your objectives are unclear. It's through the process of generative research that you brainstorm ideas for additional features, enhancements, and new products that you can serve to new or existing audience.</p>

<p>A good example of generative research is a client project I worked on a few years back. This particular client was in the business of consulting to medical home care businesses. They had a vague idea of wanting to increase their social media presence, but were unsure where they should focus their efforts amongst the social media outlets.</p>

<p>Generative research is typically comprised of interviews, field observations, and reviewing of existing literature. I spent most of my efforts doing interviews in order to gather the data I needed to define a problem.</p>

<p>After a series of interviews, the client and I settled on focusing their social media efforts on Facebook, as it had the highest concentration of the demographic they sought after.</p>

<h4>Descriptive and Explanatory Research</h4>

<p>Now that we identified a problem through generative research. Our next task is to figure out how to best solve the problem we identified.</p>

<p>The process for descriptive research is a lot like generative research, wherein I spent most of my time interviewing people who had a deeper insight than I. The main difference being, I was digging to find a solution to best solve the problem, contrary to interviewing to find a problem.</p>

<p>Again, it was through a series of interviews which gave me the perspective I needed both from the business and targeted audience point of view, that allowed me to come up with a suitable solution.</p>

<p>The proposed solution I came up with was to offer something of value to the targeted audience in exchange for a social media transaction that elevated the companies social media presence. This sounds rudimentary, but a few points to keep in mind was that the offer had to be substantial enough to warrant the attention of the targeted audience, while not draining the client of too much resource.</p>

<h4>Evaluative Research</h4>

<p>Once a solution has been proposed, you can test them against the requirements you have identified. This is usually done by employing usability testing.</p>

<p>Piggybacking off the same client example throughout this post, we shared the solution amongst the clients' workforce and gathered data which we could act upon.</p>

<p>Evaluative research is usually an ongoing iterative process. The goal is to continually improve upon the solution so as long as it meets the requirements identified.</p>

<h4>Casual Research</h4>

<p>Casual research is conducted once your solution has been implemented. This type of research can bring in expected and unexpected results in the way that users are interacting with your solution.</p>

<p>Looking at analytics and conducting A/B or multivariate testing is a big part of casual research. You are looking at data to help pinpoint patterns that can help increase the desired results.</p>

<p>I've barely scratched the surface on research. I definitely recommended picking up <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/just-enough-research">Just Enough Research</a> by Erika Hall.</p>
