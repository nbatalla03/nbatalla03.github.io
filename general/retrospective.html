  <h2>Retrospective</h2>
  <p>As I'm nearing the halfway mark of my apprenticeship I did a little exercise with my mentor Stephanie called a retro. A retro is a way for the mentor and apprentice to reflect on how the apprenticeship is progressing, it may or may not involve smiley faces.</p>

<p>I won't be going into the details of my retro, instead I'll use my retro as inspiration for this blog post. This blog post will also serve as a letter to myself at the start of my apprenticeship and double as a reminder going forward with my apprenticeship.</p>

<h4>Patience</h4>

<p>When I started my apprenticeship at 8th Light, I had made it my goal to get through the apprenticeship as quickly as possible. The problem with this approach is it causes unnecessary pressure on yourself and accelerates burnout because of unrealistic expectations.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong. Pushing yourself is something you should always be doing, but having patience gives you the mental fortitude to accept the grind, and that it's all part of the process.</p>

<h4>Be Kind To Yourself</h4>

<p>I like to set lofty goals, and sometimes I don't meet those goals. It's during those times of failure, that you should be especially kind to yourself. Give yourself the proper time to reset and refocus. Don't dwell on the failure, instead learn from it and move on.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the future will present you with turbulent roads, and by simply being kind to yourself you will be better equipped to traverse those roads even if you make a wrong turn.</p>

<h4>Communicate</h4>

<p>I am susceptible to getting absorbed into my work and block everything out. On paper it may seem like that is a great thing, but the problem is your perspective becomes narrow and you miss out on the bigger picture.</p>

<p>I'm enjoying my apprenticeship here at 8th Light, but if I had only communicated better, I may have been able to avoid going down a path that I did not want to traverse. Just as communication is an integral element of a project's success, it is as integral in the enjoyment and success of your apprenticeship.</p>

<h4>Good is Good Enough</h4>

<p>Any perfectionist can relate to this. When I work on a project I put my all into it, I simply will not settle for good enough. The problem with this mentality is burnout, it makes you stay up late at night to finish something that is good enough. Being in a constant state of burnout will have adverse effects on your health and inevitably in your work.</p>

<p>This does not mean that you should not strive for perfection, instead you should approach perfection incrementally and not go for an all or nothing approach. This will give you balance as well as a peace of mind. Remember projects are usually marathons and not sprints.</p>

<p>I'm sure there are more things I would tell my past self, but these are principles that I feel resonate strongly with me today and looking forwards to the future.</p>
